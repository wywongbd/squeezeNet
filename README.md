# SqueezeNet implementation

Based on the paper "SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size" by Forrest N. Iandola, Song Han, Matthew W. Moskewicz, Khalid Ashraf, William J. Dally, Kurt Keutzer. 

The cs231n folder contains codes used in Stanford's cs231n course assignments to aid my implementation.
